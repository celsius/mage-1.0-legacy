Beta Version 1.00:

 * pHTS provides reactive speech synthesis based on the HMM-Based Speech Synthesis System (HTS).
 
 * MAGE is the engine independent and thread safe layer of pHTS.
 
 * The size of the PHTS_AUDIO_RINGBUFFER_SIZE determines the reactivity of the application, 
   to change that in the cmake use the -DMAGE_REACTIVE=ON/OFF option. The bigget the buffer is, 
   more stable the sound output is, BUT less reactive. The smaller the buffer is, more likely 
   is to have glitches in the output audio or thread locking.
 	
 * The original training of the voices are at 16kHz ( -s 16000 -p 80 -a 0.42 ).
   In the examples/ there is no problem to use the original parameters for the synthesis 
   (-s 16000 -p 80 -a 0.42). Remember to increase the PHTS_AUDIO_RINGBUFFER_SIZE to avoid 
   thread locking ( for the cmake use the -DMAGE_REACTIVE=OFF option ). But in the 
   ofxMageExamples/ the minimum sampling frequency used is 44.1 kHz. So, the arguments we 
   propose for a natural sounding voice are -s 44100 -p 220 -a 0.76. Remember to keep the 
   PHTS_AUDIO_RINGBUFFER_SIZE as small as possible for more reactivity.
   ( for the cmake use the -DMAGE_REACTIVE=ON option ).
