This file lists the bugs you must be aware of.  Be sure to check this
file before using MAGE or pHTS.

*	Applications using MAGE should finalize and refresh the MAGE engine 
    after a certain number of labels. Otherwise the audio thread is corrupted 
    and there are glitches in the sound output.
    
*	Applications using MAGE outside of a threading environment should increase 
	the capacity of the audio ring buffer to avoid thread locking.
	( for the cmake use the -DMAGE_REACTIVE=ON/OFF option )
