                        The MAGE beta version 1.0
                        release September 30, 2011

pHTS (performative HTS) allows reactive speech synthesis and it is based on 
the HMM-Based Speech Synthesis System (HTS). MAGE is the engine independent 
and thread safe layer of pHTS and can be used in reactive application designs. 
For the synthesis of the speech waveform we use HMMs trained by HTS. 

It has been developed by University of Mons – NUMEDIART Institute and 
Acapela Group. (see "Who we are" below and "AUTHORS" in the same directory).
