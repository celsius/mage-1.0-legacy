Installation Instructions
*************************

To use MAGE pHTS with OS X, you need to have Xcode installed. 
Then you can run the all the examples from one single Xcode project, just by 
opening the .xcodeproj, selecting the example you want and clicking the 
"Build and Run" button.

To use MAGE pHTS with openFrameworks, you need to download openFrameworks 
from: http://www.openframeworks.cc/download. Then you need to copy the 
/ofxMageExamples in the /apps directory of openFrameworks, as well as copy 
the /data directory in the /ofxMageExamples. Then you can run the ofxMageExamples 
by opening the .xcodeproj and clicking the "Build and Run" button. 


Installing Xcode:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAGE is primarily developed with Xcode 3, but may work with other versions. 
To install Xcode, you need to register as an Apple developer and download 
the Xcode disk image from: https://connect.apple.com/


Installing openFrameworks:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAGE pHTS is primarily tested with of_preRelease_v0062_osx, but may work with 
other versions. To install openFrameworks, visit : http://www.openframeworks.cc/setup


Building MAGE pHTS:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	* Unzip the file 
	* open a terminal
	
	* cd MAGE_betaReleasee_v1.00
	* mkdir build
	* cd build
	* cmake -DMAGE_REACTIVE=ON/OFF ..   
					  /* you use ON option if you want to run the  */
					  /* ofxMageExamples and OFF if you want to    */ 
					  /* run the static examples				   */
		NIOTE that you can set/modify serveral options (including MAGE_REACTIVE) 
		by running the command "ccmake ." after you've run the "cmake" command the first time.
		
	* make
	* sudo make install 
	
	* MAGE pHTS are installed in /usr/local/include/mage/ and /usr/local/lib/
	* in the bin directory you will find the dynamic library and all the produced executables.
	


Building MAGE pHTS as an Xcode project:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	* Unzip the file 
	* open a terminal
	
	* cd MAGE_betaReleasee_v1.00
	* mkdir build
	* cd build
	* cmake -G Xcode -DMAGE_REACTIVE=ON/OFF ..   
					  /* you use ON option if you want to run the  */
					  /* ofxMageExamples and OFF if you want to    */ 
					  /* run the static examples				   */
					  
	* Then in the build directory you will find MAGE_PROJECT.xcodeproj, double click
	  to open it with Xcode. From there you can run any of the examples.
	  ATTENTION, you have to pass command line arguments for the executables. 
	  
	  In the sidebar, under "Executables", double click on the executable you want to run, 
	  go to the "Arguments" tab, and change the arguments dependending on your needs. 
	  By default the input arguments to be used are:
	  
	  		-td ../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/tree-dur.inf 
	  		-tf ../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/tree-lf0.inf 
	  		-tm ../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/tree-mgc.inf 
	  		-md ../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/dur.pdf 
	  		-mf ../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/lf0.pdf 
	  		-mm ../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/mgc.pdf 
	  		-dm ../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/mgc.win1 
	  		-dm ../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/mgc.win2 
	  		-dm ../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/mgc.win3 
	  		-df ../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/lf0.win1 
	  		-df ../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/lf0.win2 
	  		-df ../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/lf0.win3 
	  		-s 16000 -p 80 -a 0.42 -g 0 -l -b 0.0 
	  		-cm ../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/gv-mgc.pdf 
	  		-cf ../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/gv-lf0.pdf 
	  		-dl 1 
	  		-or ../../data/gen/qst001/ver1/mage_engine/NAME_OF_MY_OUTPUT 
	  		../../data/data/labels/gen/alice01.lab
	  
	The audio synthesised will be the first sentence of Alice in Wonderland, and 
	the produced .raw file will be created in the /data/gen/qst001/ver1/mage_engine/ 
	directory. 



Creating a new MAGE project in openFrameworks:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After you have installed MAGE pHTS, the easiest way to create a new MAGE project 
in openFrameworks is to copy one that's similar to what you want to do. 

For example:

	* Copy the example folder ofxMageExamples/ in the apps/	directory.

	* Copy the data folder ofxMageExamples/ directory.

	* In this folder, copy an example folder like: ofxMageExamples/ofxEmptyExample/ 
  	  and rename the copy to ofxMageExamples/myApp/

	* Inside the myApp/ folder open the ofxEmptyExample.xcodeproj, and then from
  	  Xcode menu go : project->rename and write "myApp" and click "ok".

	* In the sidebar, under "Targets", right click on "ofxEmptyExample" and rename 
  	  it to "myApp"

	* In the sidebar, under "Executables", double click on "ofxEmptyExample", go to 
  	  the "Arguments" tab, and change the arguments dependending on your needs. 
  	  By default the input arguments to be used are:
	
		-td ../../../../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/tree-dur.inf 
		-tf ../../../../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/tree-lf0.inf 
		-tm ../../../../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/tree-mgc.inf 
		-md ../../../../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/dur.pdf 
		-mf ../../../../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/lf0.pdf 
		-mm ../../../../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/mgc.pdf 
		-dm ../../../../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/mgc.win1 
		-dm ../../../../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/mgc.win2 
		-dm ../../../../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/mgc.win3 
		-df ../../../../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/lf0.win1 
		-df ../../../../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/lf0.win2 
		-df ../../../../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/lf0.win3 
		-s 44100 -p 220 -a 0.76 -g 0 -l -b 0.0 
		-cm ../../../../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/gv-mgc.pdf 
		-cf ../../../../../data/voices/qst001/ver1/gv-lf0.pdf 
		-dl 1 ../../../../../data/data/labels/gen/alice01.lab

The audio synthesized will be the first sentence of Alice in Wonderland.

ATTENTION : make sure that the library is well linked.
